# Project name

## Building the program

The following command produces a binary optimized for release:

```sh
just build
```

## Project template

This template supports a sensible project structure.

- The `main()` function is found in `src/main.cpp`, as it should be.
- A `.clangd` file which points to the `compile_commands.json` generated by CMake. This means you can, for example, use the [clangd vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd).
- When adding new C++ source files (.cpp), add the file paths relative to the src/ folder in the `SRC` list in CMakeLists.txt, So for the file "src/bacon/ham.cpp", just add "bacon/ham.cpp" below "main.cpp".
- Include a header file "foo/bar/baz.hpp" from "bacon/ham.cpp" simply by writing:

  ```cpp
  #include "foo/bar/baz.hpp"
  ```

- If you are changing the build directory (modify `binaryDir` in CMakePresets.json) from e.g. build/release to target/release, remember to update:
  - justfile
  - .clangd
- The project's compiler is specified in CmakePresets.json. If you are using another compiler than your the project's agreed upon defaults, use CmakeUserPresets.json to override.
